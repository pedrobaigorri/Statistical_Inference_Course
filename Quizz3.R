# Question 1:
#
# In a population of interest, a sample of 9 men yielded a sample average brain
# volume of 1,100cc and a standard deviation of 30cc. What is a 
# 95% Student's T confidence interval for the mean brain volume in this new population?

# error <- qt(0.975,df=n-1)*sd/sqrt(n)
# left <- mean-error
# right <- mean+error

sd = 30

error <- qt(0.975, df = n - 1)* sd/sqrt(n)
left <- mean - error
right <- mean + error
round(left)
round(right)

# Question 2
#
# A diet pill is given to 9 subjects over six weeks. The average difference in 
# weight (follow up - baseline) is -2 pounds. What would the standard deviation 
# of the difference in weight have to be for the upper endpoint of the 95% T 
# confidence interval to touch 0?
mean <- 2
n <- 9
a <- qt(0.975, df = n -1)
sd <- sqrt(n) * mean / a
round(sd, digits = 2)


# Question 4
#
# In a study of emergency room waiting times, investigators consider a new and 
# the standard triage systems. To test the systems, administrators selected 20 
# nights and randomly assigned the new triage system to be used on 10 nights 
# and the standard system on the remaining 10 nights. They calculated the nightly 
# median waiting time (MWT) to see a physician. The average MWT for the new system 
# was 3 hours with a variance of 0.60 while the average MWT for the old system was 
# 5 hours with a variance of 0.68. Consider the 95% confidence interval estimate 
# for the differences of the mean MWT associated with the new system. Assume a 
# constant variance. What is the interval? Subtract in this order (New System - Old System).

# Question 6
#
# To further test the hospital triage system, administrators selected 200 nights 
# and randomly assigned a new triage system to be used on 100 nights and a standard 
# system on the remaining 100 nights. They calculated the nightly median waiting time
# (MWT) to see a physician. The average MWT for the new system was 4 hours with a 
# standard deviation of 0.5 hours while the average MWT for the old system was 6 
# hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours. Consider the hypothesis of a decrease 
# in the mean MWT associated with the new treatment.

# What does the 95% independent group confidence interval with unequal variances 
# suggest vis a vis this hypothesis? (Because there's so many observations per group, 
# just use the Z quantile instead of the T.)

# Question 7
#
# Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill 
# and a placebo. Subjects’ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline 
# and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. 
# The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) 
# was −3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. 
# The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for 
# the treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. Does the change in 
# BMI over the four week period appear to differ between the treated and placebo 
# groups? Assuming normality of the underlying data and a common population variance, 
# calculate the relevant *90%* t confidence interval. Subtract in the order of 
# (Treated - Placebo) with the smaller (more negative) number first.
